## What's This Plugin

oh-my-opencode-slim is an agent orchestration plugin for OpenCode. It includes a built-in team of specialized agents that can scout a codebase, look up fresh documentation, review architecture, handle UI work, and execute well-scoped implementation tasks under one orchestrator.

The main idea is simple: instead of forcing one model to do everything, the plugin routes each part of the job to the agent best suited for it, balancing **quality, speed and cost**.

To explore the agents themselves, see **[Meet the Pantheon](#meet-the-pantheon)**. For the full feature set, see **[Features & Workflows](#features-and-workflows)** below.

### What Users Say

> “Task management went from 5/10 to 8-9/10 easily. The Orchestrator sends
> Fixers and Explorers, and I can still talk and plan with the Orchestrator in
> the same session. The experience feels way smoother now.”
>
> \- `vipor_idk`

> “I ditched all my harnesses for this beta version of omo-slim and don't look
> back or miss anything. Great work and IMHO all in the right direction.”
>
> \- `stephanschielke`

> “I love omo-slim, and can't imagine running opencode without it. I love that I
> can create a Frankenstein of models... Makes the setup such a beast.”
>
> \- `Capital-One3039`

> “It has significantly improved my workflow... Now, it is working very
> smoothly, and I love it.”

> \- `xenstar1`

### Quick Start

Copy and paste this prompt to your LLM agent (Claude Code, AmpCode, Cursor, etc.):


```
Install and configure oh-my-opencode-slim: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alvinunreal/oh-my-opencode-slim/refs/heads/master/README.md
```


### Manual Installation

```bash
bunx oh-my-opencode-slim@latest install
```

### Getting Started

The installer generates both OpenAI and OpenCode Go presets, with OpenAI active by default.

To make OpenCode Go active during install, run `bunx oh-my-opencode-slim@latest install --preset=opencode-go` or change the default preset name in `~/.config/opencode/oh-my-opencode-slim.json` after installation.

Then:

1. **Log in to the providers you want to use if you haven't already**:

   ```bash
   opencode auth login
   ```
2. **Refresh and list the models OpenCode can see**:

   ```bash
   opencode models --refresh
   ```
3. **Open your plugin config** at `~/.config/opencode/oh-my-opencode-slim.json`

4. **Update the models you want for each agent**

> [!TIP]
> It's **recommended** to understand how background orchestration works. The **[Orchestrator prompt](https://github.com/alvinunreal/oh-my-opencode-slim/blob/master/src/agents/orchestrator.ts#L28)** contains the scheduler rules, specialist routing logic, and thresholds for when work should be assigned to background agents. You can always delegate manually by calling a subagent via: `@agentName <task>`

> [!TIP]
> Because background agents are now the default workflow, it is **highly recommended** to enable and configure **[Multiplexer Integration](docs/multiplexer-integration.md)**. It automatically opens each agent in a dedicated Tmux or Zellij pane, so you can watch specialists work live while the Orchestrator continues coordinating the session.

The default generated configuration includes both `openai` and `opencode-go` presets.

```jsonc

      "fixer": { "model": "opencode-go/deepseek-v4-flash", "variant": "high", "skills": [], "mcps": [] }
    }
  }
}
```

### For Alternative Providers

To use custom providers or a mixed-provider setup, use **[Configuration](docs/configuration.md)** for the full reference. If you want a ready-made starting point, check the **[Author's Preset](docs/authors-preset.md)** and **[$30 Preset](docs/thirty-dollars-preset.md)** - the `$30` preset is the best cheap setup.

### ✅ Verify Your Setup

After installation and authentication, verify all agents are configured and responding:

```bash
opencode
```

Then run:

```
ping all agents
```

<div align="center">
  <img src="img/ping.png" alt="Ping all agents" width="600">
  <p><i>Confirmation that all configured agents are online and ready.</i></p>
</div>

If any agent fails to respond, check your provider authentication and config file.

### What's New in V2

V2 turns oh-my-opencode-slim into a scheduler-first multi-agent workflow system.
The Orchestrator stays focused on planning, delegation, reconciliation, and
verification while specialists do the work in their own lanes.

- **[Background agents](#background-agents)** — the Orchestrator now dispatches
  specialists as background tasks, tracks task/session IDs, waits for completion
  events, and reconciles results before continuing.
- **[Companion](#companion)** — an optional floating desktop window shows which
  agents are currently active, including parallel background specialists.
- **[Deepwork](#deepwork)** — a structured workflow for large, multi-file, risky,
  or phased coding work using persistent plan files and Oracle review gates.
- **[Reflect](#reflect)** — reviews repeated work patterns and suggests reusable skills,
  agents, commands, config rules, prompt rules, or project playbooks.
- **[Worktrees](#worktrees)** — manages Git worktrees as isolated coding lanes
  with safety protocols for complex, risky, or parallel tasks.
- **[oh-my-opencode-slim skill](#oh-my-opencode-slim-skill)** — a bundled
  configuration skill that helps tune models, prompts, custom agents, MCP access,
  presets, and plugin behavior safely.

#### Background Agents

V2 makes background specialists the default mental model: the Orchestrator plans
the work graph, launches the right agents, avoids overlapping write ownership,
and waits for terminal task results before acting on them.

See **[Background Orchestration](docs/v2-background-orchestration.md)** for the
full scheduler model.

#### Companion

The optional Companion is a floating desktop status window for live agent
activity. It shows the current session state and which agents are active, so
background work is easier to follow at a glance.

<div align="center">
  <img src="img/companion.gif" alt="Companion showing active agents" width="600">
  <p><i>Left bottom visual companion.</i></p>
</div>

During interactive install, the installer asks whether to enable Companion and
defaults to `yes`. For automation, enable it explicitly with:

```bash
bunx oh-my-opencode-slim@latest install --companion=yes
```

See **[Companion](docs/companion.md)** for configuration, positions, sizes, and
install details.

#### Deepwork

Deepwork is for heavy coding sessions: broad refactors, multi-phase features,
risky architecture changes, or work that needs a persistent plan. It creates a
local markdown progress file, uses Oracle review gates, and keeps implementation
phases structured.

Start it with:

```text
/deepwork <heavy coding task>
```

See **[Skills](docs/skills.md#deepwork)** for when to use it and how the workflow
runs.

#### Reflect

Reflect helps the Orchestrator learn from repeated workflow friction. It reviews
recent work and existing assets, then recommends the smallest useful improvement:
a skill, custom agent, command, config rule, prompt rule, MCP permission change,
or project playbook. If there is not enough evidence, it should recommend
creating nothing.

Use it directly with:

```text
/reflect
/reflect release workflow and checks
```

Or with natural prompts like:

```text
reflect on my recent workflows
find repeated work worth turning into reusable instructions
```

See **[Skills](docs/skills.md#reflect)** for the full workflow and guardrails.

#### Worktrees

Worktrees manages Git worktrees as safe, isolated coding lanes under `.slim/worktrees/<slug>/`. The Orchestrator manages the lifecycle of these lanes, tracks state in `.slim/worktrees.json`, dispatches specialist agents inside them, and requires explicit confirmation before mutating git state.

See **[Skills](docs/skills.md#worktrees)** for the safety protocol.

#### oh-my-opencode-slim Skill

The bundled `oh-my-opencode-slim` skill helps the Orchestrator configure and
improve the plugin itself. Use it for model tuning, custom agents, prompt
overrides, skill/MCP permissions, presets, optional agents, background
orchestration, and recurring workflow friction.

<div align="center">
  <img src="img/oh-my-opencode-skill.png" alt="oh-my-opencode-slim skill in use" width="600">
  <p><i>Ask the bundled skill to tune and improve your agent setup.</i></p>
</div>

See **[Skills](docs/skills.md#oh-my-opencode-slim)** for examples and safety
rules.

### 04. Council: The Chorus of Minds

> [!NOTE]
> **Why doesn't Orchestrator auto-call Council more often?** This is intentional. Council runs multiple models at once, so automatic delegation is kept strict because it is usually the highest-cost path in the system. In practice, Council is meant to be used manually when you want it, for example: <code>@council compare these two architectures</code>.

<table>

    </td>
    <td width="70%" valign="top">
      The Council is not a lone being but a chamber of minds summoned when one answer is not enough. It sends your question to multiple models in parallel, gathers their competing judgments, and then the Council agent itself distills the strongest ideas into a single verdict. Where a solitary agent may miss a path, the Council cross-examines possibility itself.

## Optional Agents

### Observer: The Silent Witness

> [!NOTE]
> **Why a separate agent?** If your Orchestrator model is not multimodal, enable Observer to handle images, screenshots, PDFs, and other visual files. Observer is disabled by default and gives the Orchestrator a dedicated multimodal reader without forcing you to change your main reasoning model. Set `disabled_agents: []` and an `observer` model in your configuration. The bundled `opencode-go` install preset does this automatically because its GLM Orchestrator is not multimodal.

<table>

    <td width="70%" valign="top">

**Read-only visual analysis** — interprets images, screenshots, PDFs, and diagrams. Returns structured observations to the orchestrator without loading raw file bytes into the main context window.

- Images, screenshots, diagrams → `read` tool (native image support)
- PDFs and binary documents → `read` tool (text + structure extraction)
- **Disabled by default** — enable with `"disabled_agents": []` and configure a vision-capable model; installing with `--preset=opencode-go` enables it with `opencode-go/kimi-k2.6`
